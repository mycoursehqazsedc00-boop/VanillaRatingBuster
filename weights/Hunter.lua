-- weights/Hunter.lua
--
-- Assumptions:
--   - 305 weapon skill (book-trained) -> 7% hit cap (new system)
--   - Trueshot Aura now baseline (1.18.1), assumed always active
--   - Steady Shot now baseline (1.18.1)
--   - AGI = 1.0 anchor (gives ~2 RAP, crit, dodge)
--   - Survival: AGI worth more due to Lightning Reflexes talent multiplier,
--     melee AP weighted higher than ranged AP
--
-- 1.18.0 changes applied:
--   - Mongoose Bite now hits both weapons for Surv DW -> AP weight up
--   - Lacerate scales with melee AP -> AP weight up for Surv
--   - Rapid Fire now increases melee + ranged attack speed -> HASTE up for Surv
--
-- 1.18.1 changes applied:
--   - Arcane Shot now scales with ranged weapon damage -> RAP weight up for MM
--   - Volley now has AP scaling -> RAP weight up for MM
--   - Lock and Load procs off MM crits -> CRIT weight up for MM
--   - Rapid Fire now reduces Aimed/Steady Shot cast time -> HASTE up for MM
--   - Kill Command now procs off hunter crits (BM) -> CRIT weight up for BM
--   - Bestial Wrath returned, Scent of Blood added -> pet AP scaling up for BM
--   - Lacerate damage buffed 35% -> 40% AP -> AP weight up for Surv
--   - Surefooted gives +3% hit while DW for Surv -> noted in comment
