-- Assumptions:
--   - SP = 1.0 anchor stat for all specs
--   - Spell hit cap: 16% (shown across all sheets, talents included)
--   - INT: high value for Arcane (mana = DPS), lower for Fire/Frost
--   - SPI: meaningful for Arcane due to mana sustain, low elsewhere
--   - SPELLCRIT: highest for Fire (Ignite/Combustion), very high for Frost
--     (Shatter combos), moderate for Arcane
--   - HASTE: high for Arcane (more Arcane Blasts per cast sequence),
--     moderate for Fire (faster Scorch/Fireball), low for Frost
--   - MANAREG: relevant for long fights; Arcane most mana-hungry
--
-- 1.18.0 changes applied:
--   - Ignite duration reduced 6s -> 4s; more Fire Mages needed to maintain
--     stacks, individual crit more competitive -> Fire SPELLCRIT up
--   - Hot Streak reduced to 2 ranks -> slightly more accessible, mild buff
--     to crit value for Fire
--
-- 1.18.1 changes applied:
--   - Improved Fire Blast GCD reduction increased -> minor HASTE value up
--     for Fire (faster rotation cadence)
