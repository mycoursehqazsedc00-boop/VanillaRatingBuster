-- weights/Rogue.lua
--
-- Assumptions:
--   - AGI = 1.0 anchor (gives AP, crit, dodge — core rogue stat)
--   - AP: high value across all specs, roughly 0.5x AGI per point
--   - All sheets show AGI ~817-845, AP ~2750-2944, hit ~22-25%
--   - Weapon skill book = TRUE on all sheets; 305 skill assumed
--     -> 7% hit cap (same as Hunter new system assumption)
--     NOTE: Rogue hit cap for yellow attacks (specials) is separate;
--     these weights focus on overall hit value including white attacks
--   - CRIT: high value for all specs due to combo point generation
--     and Seal Fate (Dagger/Sub) talent
--   - HASTE: moderate; speeds up auto-attack and energy regen indirectly
--   - Dagger: highest crit weight (Seal Fate, Backstab crits)
--   - Combat (Sword/Fist): more AP-focused, slower but harder-hitting
--   - Sub: crit-focused like Dagger but slightly different AP/agi balance
--
-- 1.18.0 changes applied:
--   - Blade Rush (Combat) now reduces energy regen tick interval by Agility
--     -> AGI gives energy regen on top of normal benefits for Combat -> up
--   - Honor Among Thieves (Sub) now also triggers from own crits, CD reduced
--     -> crit generates energy for Sub -> CRIT weight up for Sub
--   - Mark for Death (Sub) now scales AP/SP from rogue's melee AP
--     -> ATTACKPOWER weight up for Sub (more AP = bigger raid buff)
--
-- 1.18.1 changes applied:
--   - Taste for Blood now 2 points, damage scales per combo point
--     -> no direct stat weight change
--   - Corrosive/Dissolvent Poison restricted to specific mob types
--     -> no stat weight change
